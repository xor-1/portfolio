## Things you need:
- CentOS 9
- VM Ware Workstation
- Configuration Files
- 12 Gigs of RAM
- 500 Gigs of Storage

First thing first download the configuration files from the following link.

First, you must set your VM ware Configuration according to the following Screenshot.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34524ad0-77c4-4606-981f-65d77ac9a23e)

Set RAM to 8 GB Minimum you can Use 16 GB or 24 GB depending upon your RAM size.

Add 5 hard drives, 100 GB for CentOS, which is already available starting from 20 GB. Additionally, we need 4 local hard drives for installing various VMs on Open Stack. The sizes of these local hard drives range from 30 GB to 50 GB.

Add 3 network adapters to the CentOS VM configuration in VMware settings. One adapter is already available, and you need to add 2 more.

Your cent OS Network Adapter should be at `NAT` settings

- The second network adapter will be a `HOST-only` setting.
- The third network adapter will be a `bridged` connection.

Make sure to match the configuration with the first screenshot at the top of this article. Name your VM and set the username and password for your CentOS login screen. Leave the other settings as they are. Close the settings and then turn on your VM. The installation process of CentOS is fully automated.

Please ensure that your internet is working properly and that all adapters are functioning correctly. You can check them from the VMware Status bar or the Network panel of CentOS. Currently, `ens224` is turned off.

On Desktop, click on activities Open terminal the terminal.

Now use this Command for the OpenStack local hostname.

```console
su
hostnamectl set-hostname openstackio --static 
```

`openstackio` is the name. You can use any name of your choice. This execution of the command will set the local hostname only. This execution of the Command will result in nothing and will set the local host name only.

To configure your IP with your local host. I use an ens160 IP address. Use the command to map your IP to the local host. The name for the local host should be the same as set in the previous command. Then use the cat command with directories to verify your mapping:

```console
echo "192.168.109.128 openstackio" >> /etc/hosts
cat /etc/hosts
```

Now use these Commands:

```console
setenforce 0 
sed -i 's/^SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e098d675-565e-41ee-a30a-091dfbba6a5e)

Now use the following command the following command to install the network

systemctl disable - now firewalld NetworkManager 
systemctl enable - now network 
dnf -y install lvm2
```

```console
fdisk -l
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f3995f5-e106-4b20-b0da-dd07efc1a877)

Now use these commands for more configuration making tables and groups in free space.

```console
pvcreate -f /dev/nvme0n2
pvs 
vgcreate -f cinder-volumes /dev/nvme0n2 
vgs 
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n3 
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n4
```

Now use this Command:

```console
yum install dnf-plugins-core
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acfe6ec3-b403-4bf5-9895-8fa067a552da)

Upon completing this, the following output will be displayed.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d971b23-ebc0-4330-8b10-3280e73738ae)

After this, we will utilize the following command to install the necessary and additional packages, which will take some time.

```console
dnf update –y
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4261c70-a2a8-4985-8c88-c2a59ad75a37)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be12740d-0877-4ebd-ad0c-6d758f7ae8e4)

Now it’s time to install OpenStack. Use the following command to install OpenStack. It will also take some time to download and install packages. Also, you need some changes in the configuration file in `yum.repos.d`.

```console
dnf install -y openstack-packstack
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcc9844a-e8e2-4f76-b276-3d24cdda95d1)

Upon completing this, the following output will be displayed.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/147af082-4743-4c9a-b6fc-f585e6aca3bc)

Now use these commands to allow access to file of Configuration.

```console
packstack --gen-answer-file=answer.txt
```

![https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45d1e187-1215-4b77-b9d1-4bc18c626ed3]

Now, use `nano` to edit the configuration file `answer.txt`. Search and make changes to the following lines. Use `ctrl+w` to search and arrows to move the cursor.

```console
CONFIG_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=admin123
CONFIG_HEAT_INSTALL=y
CONFIG_MAGNUM_INSTALL=y
CONFIG_SSL_CERT_DIR=~/packstackca/
CONFIG_SSL_CACERT_SELFSIGN=y
CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_C=ID
CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_ST=Punjab
CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_L=Islamabad
CONFIG_KEYSTONE_ADMIN_PW=admin123
CONFIG_CINDER_VOLUMES_CREATE=n
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS=extnet:br-ex
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_BRIDGE_IFACES=br-ex:ens160
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_BRIDGES_COMPUTE=br-ex
CONFIG_NOVA_LIBVIRT_VIRT_TYPE=qemu
CONFIG_HORIZON_SSL=y
CONFIG_SWIFT_STORAGES=/dev/nvme0n3,/dev/nvme0n4
CONFIG_SWIFT_STORAGE_REPLICAS=2
CONFIG_SWIFT_STORAGE_FSTYPE=ext4
CONFIG_PROVISION_DEMO=n
```

`admin123` is a sample password. You can use a password of your choice. Press `Ctrl+X` to save and quit the file, then `press Y` to ensure that the file is written successfully and saved. After that, use this command. It will take a bit longer to complete the configuration we have just done.


```console
packstack --answer-file=answer.txt
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e424772-20b4-4633-b47f-17814f04ec7c)

Upon completing this, the following output will be displayed.

Now use this last command

```console
dnf install -y wget
```

You can access your OpenStack on your browser using:

```console
https://<ip-address>/dashboard
```

## Note
Please make sure to use your IP to access your OpenStack Dashboard. When prompted for login credentials at the OpenStack login screen, use the following:

**Username**: `admin`

**Password**: `admin123` (use your password as per your setup)

After logging in, you will see the following screen in your browser.
