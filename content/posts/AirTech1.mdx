## Let's get Cracking...

## Challenge 01: Back to the bases

There was a Wire Shark file given in order for us solve the challenge. You can also download the challenge file by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GxLGt2S1KLYBKQAXET9-4UoKqC1StOuk/view?usp=sharing)

When I opened the file I noticed that there are some `TCP` packets.

So without any delay I followed the `TCP` Stream from `Analyze > Follow > TCP Stream` menu. After following it I found the following chat.

As they are talking about a file. So I applied the FTP filter and found a `flag.txt` file.

So I extracted it from `File > Extract Object > FTP Data`.

After saving and opening the file I found the following text.

``` CIPHER

```

Now if you remember from the chat there where two more leads as well.

- Can you pass me the `XOR` key.
- ssure btw its `5`

So I simply opened [CyberChief](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and typed `XOR` and used `05` as the key but sadly it didn't work.

But when you have a key you always have the option to Brute Force it. When I Brute Forced the cipher I found a base64 encoded string.

Simply decoded the string and got the flag.

Flag: `AT24{y4m44444t33333_kud@$@1}`
